## Introduction

</p>

We introduce Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), a novel framework aimed at improving the efficiency of inference in large language models (LLMs). RSD employs a process reward model to evaluate intermediate decoding steps from draft model, and dynamically decide whether to invoke the target model, optimizing the trade-off between computational cost and output quality. Extensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including Olympiad-level tasks, show that RSD delivers **significant efficiency gains** against decoding with the target model only (up to **4.4x fewer FLOPs**), while achieving significant **better accuracy** than parallel decoding method on average (up to **+3.5**).

## Support
- [x] **vLLM online mode**: Need at least 3 GPUs to serve the draft, target, and process reward model, since vLLM doesn't support serving multiple models on 1 GPU.

## News
- [2025/05/01] 🎊 RSD is accepted to ICML2025 as a poster 


## Installation
```shell
# For math evaluation
pip install -r requirements.txt 

# For using Skywork-PRM
git clone https://github.com/SkyworkAI/skywork-o1-prm-inference.git
cd skywork-o1-prm-inference
pip install -e .
```

## Efficient Decoding
**1. Preparation**

We mainly use [Qwen2.5-Math family](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen25-math-66eaa240a1b7d5ee65f1da3e) and [Skywork-o1-Open-PRM-Qwen-2.5-1.5B](https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-o1-Open-PRM-Qwen-2.5-1.5B). You need to change ``max_position_embeddings`` in their config.json from 4096 to 16384, which aims to avoid max_tokens error in vLLM. We only use the generation shorter than 4096, so this change won't affect the performance.

**2. Model serve**
```shell
bash scripts/serve_draft_model.sh
bash scripts/serve_target_model.sh
bash scripts/serve_prm.sh 
```

**3. Evaluation**
```shell
bash scripts/math_eval.sh
````
